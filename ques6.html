<h2 id="topic1">Topic 1: Overview</h2>
<p>
    This chapter begins unlocking the power of web-based application development with
HTML5. Unlike programming languages, such as C, C++, C#, Java and Visual Basic,
HTML5 is a markup language that specifies the structure and content of documents that
are displayed in web browsers.
We introduce some basics, then cover more sophisticated HTML5 techniques such as:
• tables, which are particularly useful for structuring information from databases
(i.e., software that stores structured sets of data)
• forms for collecting information from web-page visitors
• internal linking for easier page navigation
• meta elements for specifying information about a document
In Chapter 3, we introduce many new features in HTML5. In Chapter 4, we discuss
CSS3, a technology for specifying how web pages look</p>

<h2 id="topic2">Topic 2: Editing HTML5</h2>
<p>We'll create HTML5 documents by typing HTML5 markup text in a text editor (such as
    Notepad, TextEdit, vi, emacs) and saving it with the .html or .htm filename extension.
    Computers called web servers store HTML5 documents. Clients (such as web browsers
    running on your local computer or smartphone) request specific resources such as
    HTML5 documents from web servers. For example, typing www.deitel.com/books/
    downloads.html into a web browser's address field requests the file downloads.html from
    the books directory on the web server running at www.deitel.com. We discuss web servers
    in Chapter 17. For now, you'll simply place the HTML5 documents on your computer
    and render (i.e., display) them by opening them locally with a web browser</p>

<h2 id="topic3">Topic 3: First HTML5 Example</h2>
<p>This chapter presents HTML5 markup capabilities and provides screen captures that show
    how a browser renders (that is, displays) the HTML5. You can download the examples

    2.3 First HTML5 Example 39
    from www.pearsonhighered.com/deitel. The HTML5 documents we show have line
    numbers for your convenience—these are not part of the documents. Open each HTML5
    document in various web browsers so you can view and interact with it.
    Figure 2.1 is an HTML5 document named main.html, which is stored in the examples/ch02 folder. This first example displays the message Welcome to HTML5! in the
    browser. Now let's consider each line of the document.
    Document Type Declaration
The document type declaration (DOCTYPE) in line 1 is required in HTML5 documents so
that browsers render the page in standards mode, according to the HTML and CSS specifications. Some browsers operate in quirks mode to maintain backward compatibility
with web pages that are not up-to-date with the latest standards. You’ll include the DOCTYPE in each HTML5 document you create.
Blank Lines
We include blank lines (lines 2 and 10) to make our documents easier to read—the browser ignores them.
Comments
Lines 3–4 are HTML5 comments. You’ll insert comments in your HTML5 markup to
improve readability and describe the content of a document. The browser ignores comments when your document is rendered. HTML5 comments start with <!-- and end with
-->. We include in our examples comments that specify the figure number and file name
and state the example’s purpose. We’ll often include additional comments, especially to
explain new features.

html, head and body Elements
HTML5 markup contains text (and images, graphics, animations, audios and videos) that
represents the content of a document and elements that specify a document’s structure and
meaning. Some important elements are the html element (which starts in line 5 and ends
in line 14), the head element (lines 6–9) and the body element (lines 11–13). The html
element encloses the head section (represented by the head element) and the body section
(represented by the body element). The head section contains information about the
HTML5 document, such as the character set (UTF-8, the most popular character-encoding
scheme for the web) that the page uses (line 7)—which helps the browser determine how
to render the content—and the title (line 8). The head section also can contain special
document-formatting instructions called CSS3 style sheets and client-side programs
called scripts for creating dynamic web pages. (We introduce CSS3 style sheets in Chapter 4
and explain scripting with the JavaScript language in Chapters 6–13.) The body section
contains the page’s content, which the browser displays when the user visits the web page.
Start Tags and End Tags
HTML5 documents delimit most elements with a start tag and an end tag. A start tag consists of the element name in angle brackets (for example, <html> in line 5). An end tag consists of the element name preceded by a forward slash (/) in angle brackets (for example,
</html> in line 14). There are several so-called “void elements” that do not have end tags.
As you’ll soon see, many start tags have attributes that provide additional information
about an element, which browsers use to determine how to process the element. Each attribute has a name and a value separated by an equals sign (=).</p>

<h2 id="topic4">Topic 4: W3C HTML Validation Service</h2>
<p>You must use proper HTML5 syntax to ensure that browsers process your documents
    properly. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) provides a validation service (at
    validator.w3.org) for checking a document’s syntax. Documents can be validated by
    • providing the URL of an online web page
    • uploading a file to the validator
    • pasting code directly into a text area provided on the validator site
    All of the HTML5 examples in this book have been validated by uploading a file to:
    To use validator.w3.org/#validate-by-upload, click the Choose File button to
    select a file from your computer to validate. Next, click More Options. In the Document
    Type drop-down list, select HTML5 (experimental). Select the Verbose Output checkbox,
    then click the Check button to validate your document. If it contains syntax errors, the
    validation service displays error messages describing the errors. Since the HTML5 validator is still considered experimental, you’ll receive a warning each time you validate an
    HTML5 document.</p>

    <h2 id="topic5">Topic 5: Headings</h2>
    <p>Some text in an HTML5 document may be more important than other text. HTML5 provides six heading elements (h1 through h6) for specifying the relative importance of information (Fig. 2.2). Heading element h1 (line 12) is considered the most significant one and is
        typically rendered in a larger font than the other five (lines 13–17). Each successive heading
        element (h2, h3, etc.) is typically rendered in a progressively smaller font.</p>
